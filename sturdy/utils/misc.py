# LRU Cache with TTL
def ttl_cache(maxsize: int = 128, typed: bool = False, ttl: int = -1) -> Any:
    """
    Decorator that creates a cache of the most recently used function calls with a time-to-live (TTL) feature.
    The cache evicts the least recently used entries if the cache exceeds the `maxsize` or if an entry has
    been in the cache longer than the `ttl` period.

    Args:
        maxsize (int): Maximum size of the cache. Once the cache grows to this size, subsequent entries
                       replace the least recently used ones. Defaults to 128.
        typed (bool): If set to True, arguments of different types will be cached separately. For example,
                      f(3) and f(3.0) will be treated as distinct calls with distinct results. Defaults to False.
        ttl (int): The time-to-live for each cache entry, measured in seconds. If set to a non-positive value,
                   the TTL is set to a very large number, effectively making the cache entries permanent. Defaults to -1.

    Returns:
        Callable: A decorator that can be applied to functions to cache their return values.

    The decorator is useful for caching results of functions that are expensive to compute and are called
    with the same arguments frequently within short periods of time. The TTL feature helps in ensuring
    that the cached values are not stale.

    Example:
        @ttl_cache(ttl=10)
        def get_data(param):
            # Expensive data retrieval operation
            return data

    Retrieves the current block number from the blockchain. This method is cached with a time-to-live (TTL)

    reducing the number of calls to the underlying blockchain interface.

        int: The current block number on the blockchain.

    This method is useful for applications that need to access the current block number frequently and can
    tolerate a delay of up to 12 seconds for the latest information. By using a cache with TTL, the method
    efficiently reduces the workload on the blockchain interface.
